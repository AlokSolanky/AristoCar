This tracker is a guideline and can be adapted as we progress.
It prioritizes tasks where I can directly contribute to the frontend and Genkit AI flows.
Backend API integration will be a recurring need for most features to become fully functional.
Focus is on User-to-User (C2C) interactions within the Indian market context.
