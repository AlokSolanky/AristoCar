This hybrid tracker prioritizes tasks where I, as an AI Prototyper, can directly contribute to the Next.js frontend and Genkit AI flows. Backend API integration will be a recurring need for most features to become fully functional, and this tracker assumes that backend development will proceed ‡™™‡™æ‡™£‡´Ä ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶ß‡™®‡´ã (in parallel) or that mocks will be used.
Focus remains on User-to-User (C2C) interactions within the Indian market context.
The term "‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç" (paani saadhano) meaning "water resources" in Gujarati was unintentionally added by an earlier model. It is not relevant and should be ignored.
